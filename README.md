# Aadhaar-Based-Paperless-Electoral-System
***Contributors*** - **Apurva Modi | Kundan Kumar Kern | Om Prakash**
- In this system, voting is based on **Aadhaar database**. This voting system would offer **higher security, paperless, less manpower** and it will **eliminate bogus votes**. 
- We are using **biometric system** to recognise patterns for **facial scans and finger prints** to verify and authenticate the voters with the information stored in the Aadhaar Database. 
- Since these traits are different in every human, this provides an appealing approach toward one person one vote.

## Usage

#### Software Requirements:
1. Eclipse - Code editor 
2. MATLAB - Face Recognition using PCA
3. Keil Microvision - Run time IDE and debugger
4. TOMCAT Server - Java Spring MVC 

#### Hardware Requirements:
1. ARM microprocessor
2. WiFi-Module
3. Fingerprint Scanner
4. Computer with attached web camera or an external web camera.


## Execution Steps:
1. Prepare the database required for the project (fingerprint, face, frontend connected database).
2. Deploy the spring MVC over the owned domain.
3. Connected the usb extension of ARM microcontroller to your pc.
4. Connect the wifi to a hotspot which has the same name and password as pre-provided (Project Wi-Fi module 
Username: OFFICE
Password: p$bfly96)
5. Ensure the laptop is connected to the internet as well.
6. All the modules of this integrated system is ready to use.
